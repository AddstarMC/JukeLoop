JukeLoop makes Jukeboxes a lot cooler. Jukeboxes will loop, replaying the disc when the song ends.  If a chest is directly adjacent to a jukebox, it will loop through the discs in the chest.  And now, jukeboxes will even attempt to place discs into a hopper directly below them, and take discs from another hopper attached to the top, or any of the 4 sides.
