JukeLoop makes Jukeboxes a lot cooler. Jukeboxes will loop, replaying the disc when the song ends.  If a chest is directly adjacent to a jukebox, it will loop through the discs in the chest.  And now, jukeboxes will even attempt to place discs into a hopper directly below them, and take discs from another hopper attached to the top, or any of the 4 sides.

== Features ==

* Records will start playing automatically even after a server restart. (locations of jukeboxes stored in config)
* Rotate through records in a chest placed adjacent to the jukebox.
* Punch the jukebox to skip the song.


== Commands ==


 * None


== Permissions ==

* 'jukeloop.use' - players with this permission will automatically have their jukeboxes repeat.
