JukeLoop makes Jukeboxes a lot cooler.  Jukeboxes automatically start, repeat, and loop through and records in adjacent chests or hoppers.  Finished discs can be deposited into hoppers directly below jukeboxes.  The current song can be skipped by either punching the jukebox or delivering a redstone pulse.
